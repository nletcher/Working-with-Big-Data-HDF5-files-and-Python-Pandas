# Working-with-Big-Data-HDF5-files-and-Python-Pandas
HDF files are designed to store large amounts of data in hierarchical format. In this project, I used Pandas to do the following:
1. How to access specific dataset in HDF file using pandas
2. How to create group and subgroups in HDF file by using pandas
3. How access datasets in the HDF hierarchy by using pandas
4. Data visualization in HDF big data files by using pandas
